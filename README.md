 Notes    : OCTranspo requires developers to generate their own API key and affix with the URL.
 
 API key can be obtained at http://www.octranspo.com/en/plan-your-trip/travel-tools/developers/dev-doc#v1_3_docs.
 
 My program retrives dat in JSON form. But OCTranspo's default setting is xml. So you need to add <URL>&format=json.
